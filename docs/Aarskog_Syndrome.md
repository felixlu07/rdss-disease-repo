### Aarskog Syndrome





#### Disease Overview


Aarskog Syndrome, also known as Aarskog-Scott syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects males. It is characterized by distinct facial features, short stature, and abnormalities in the skeletal, musculoskeletal, and genital systems. The condition can manifest in various ways, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe.





#### Disease Category


Genetic Disorder





#### Synonyms


- Aarskog-Scott Syndrome


- Faciodigitogenital Syndrome


- Faciogenital Dysplasia





#### Signs & Symptoms


The signs and symptoms of Aarskog Syndrome can vary widely but may include:


- Facial abnormalities: Widely spaced eyes, a short nose with an upturned tip, a wide philtrum, and a widow's peak hairline.


- Short stature: Individuals with Aarskog Syndrome often have disproportionally short stature.


- Skeletal anomalies: Short fingers and toes, clinodactyly (curved fifth finger), and brachydactyly (shortened fingers and toes).


- Genital abnormalities: Shawl scrotum (a condition where the scrotum surrounds the penis), undescended testes, and inguinal hernia.


- Other features: Dental issues, mild to moderate intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and delayed puberty.





#### Causes


Aarskog Syndrome is caused by mutations in the FGD1 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. This gene is responsible for producing a protein that plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of the cytoskeleton in various cell types. The disorder follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, which means males are primarily affected, while females can be carriers of the mutated gene.





#### Affected Populations


Aarskog Syndrome predominantly affects males, with symptoms more severe in males due to the X-linked nature of the disorder. Females who are carriers of the mutation often exhibit milder symptoms or may be asymptomatic. The exact prevalence is unknown, but it is considered rare.





#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms


Several conditions may exhibit overlapping symptoms with Aarskog Syndrome, including:


- Noonan Syndrome


- Turner Syndrome


- Cornelia de Lange Syndrome


- Robinow Syndrome


- Silver-Russell Syndrome





#### Diagnosis


Diagnosis of Aarskog Syndrome is primarily clinical, based on the presence of characteristic physical features and family history. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis by identifying mutations in the FGD1 gene. Additional tests such as skeletal X-rays, hormonal evaluations, and dental examinations may be conducted to assess the extent of abnormalities.





#### Standard Therapies


There is no cure for Aarskog Syndrome, but management focuses on addressing the symptoms. Treatment options include:


- Growth hormone therapy: May be considered to improve growth in some cases.


- Surgical interventions: Required for genital abnormalities such as undescended testes or hernias.


- Orthopedic treatments: To manage skeletal abnormalities.


- Educational support and behavioral therapies: To assist with learning disabilities and behavioral issues.


- Regular follow-up: With various specialists including geneticists, endocrinologists, orthopedists, and dentists.





#### Clinical Trials and Studies


Information about ongoing clinical trials and research studies can be accessed through databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov or by contacting research institutions specializing in genetic disorders.
