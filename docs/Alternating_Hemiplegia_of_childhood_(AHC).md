# Alternating Hemiplegia of childhood (AHC)
### Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC)

#### Disease Overview
Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by transient episodes of hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body). It typically begins in infancy and early childhood. The episodes can affect one or both sides of the body and can vary in duration, from minutes to days. In addition to hemiplegia, individuals with AHC may experience a wide range of neurological symptoms, including dystonia (muscle contractions), developmental delays, and other neurological impairments.

#### Disease Category
AHC falls under the category of rare genetic neurological disorders.

#### Synonyms
- Alternating Cerebral Hemiplegia of Childhood
- Periodic Alternating Hemiplegia

#### Signs & Symptoms
- Recurrent episodes of hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body)
- Paroxysmal disturbances such as dystonia, quadriplegia, nystagmus, and ataxia
- Developmental delay or intellectual disabilities
- Episodes of bilateral plegia (paralysis on both sides of the body)
- Involuntary eye movements
- Seizures
- Movement disorders appearing between episodes

#### Causes
AHC is primarily caused by mutations in the ATP1A3 gene, which plays a role in neuron function and brain activity. The ATP1A3 gene provides instructions for making one part of an enzyme called Na+/K+-ATPase, which is essential for normal cellular function.

#### Affected Populations
AHC is an extremely rare condition with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 1 million births. It affects both males and females equally and manifests typically before 18 months of age.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Epilepsy: Recurrent seizures may mimic some symptoms.
- Hemiplegic Migraine: This condition also causes temporary paralysis on one side of the body.
- Other Genetic Neurological Disorders: Conditions like Rett syndrome or mitochondrial disorders may present with overlapping symptoms.

#### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Evaluation:** Detailed history of the patient's symptoms and episodes.
- **Genetic Testing:** Analysis of the ATP1A3 gene to identify mutations.
- **Neuroimaging:** MRI or CT scans can be used to rule out other neurological disorders.
- **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** To evaluate brain activity and identify related seizure disorders.

#### Standard Therapies
Currently, there is no cure for AHC. Treatments focus on managing symptoms and improving the quality of life:
- **Medications:** Sodium oxybate has shown some effectiveness in reducing the frequency of episodes. Other medications may include seizure management drugs such as benzodiazepines or antiepileptic drugs.
- **Therapies:** Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy might help manage developmental delays and improve motor skills.
- **Lifestyle Modifications:** Identifying and avoiding triggers, such as stress, sleep deprivation, and extreme temperatures.

#### Clinical Trials and Studies
Information on active clinical trials and studies can be found on platforms like ClinicalTrials.gov. These studies aim to explore new treatments, understand the disease mechanism, and improve patient care.

#### Complete Report
Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) is a rare, typically early onset, neurological disorder characterized by transient episodes of hemiplegia, which can affect one or both sides of the body. The symptoms can change over time, with some episodes lasting minutes while others may continue for days. The condition is caused by mutations in the ATP1A3 gene, which affects neuron functions in the brain. Because AHC is so rare, affecting approximately 1 in 1 million births, it tends to be under-recognized and misdiagnosed. Diagnosis involves genetic testing, particularly focused on the ATP1A3 gene, as well as clinical evaluations and neuroimaging. There is currently no cure for AHC, and treatment is symptomatic, aiming to reduce the frequency and severity of the episodes. A variety of therapeutic interventions and lifestyle modifications can significantly aid management of the condition.
