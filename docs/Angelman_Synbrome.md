# Angelman Synbrome
### Angelman Syndrome

#### Disease Overview
Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. Characterized by developmental delays, speech impediments, movement and balance issues, and a happy, excitable demeanor, AS is often first suspected due to its unique combination of symptoms.

#### Disease Category
Genetic Disorder

#### Synonyms
- AS
- Angelman's Syndrome
- Happy Puppet Syndrome (Note: this term is outdated and considered inappropriate by many)

#### Signs & Symptoms
- Severe developmental delay
- Absence or severely limited speech
- Frequent smiling and laughter
- Happy, excitable demeanor
- Ataxia (loss of control of body movements)
- Seizures, usually beginning before age 3
- Microcephaly (small head size)
- Sleep disturbances
- Hyperactivity
- Fascination with water
- Strabismus (crossed eyes)

#### Causes
Angelman Syndrome is typically caused by problems with a gene located on chromosome 15 called UBE3A. This can occur due to various genetic mechanisms, such as:
- Deletion of the maternal 15q11-q13 region
- UBE3A mutation
- Paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15
- Imprinting defects in the chromosome 15 region

#### Affected Populations
Angelman Syndrome affects both males and females equally and is found across all racial groups. The prevalence is estimated to be between 1 in 12,000 to 20,000 people.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Rett Syndrome
- Prader-Willi Syndrome
- Cerebral Palsy
- Autism Spectrum Disorders
- Mowat-Wilson Syndrome

#### Diagnosis
Diagnosis is typically made through a combination of clinical evaluation and genetic testing. Key diagnostic steps may include:
- Detailed patient history and physical examination
- Molecular genetic testing to identify UBE3A gene mutations or chromosome 15 abnormalities
- EEG to observe characteristic patterns associated with AS

#### Standard Therapies
While there is no cure for Angelman Syndrome, treatments focus on managing symptoms:
- Anti-seizure medications for epilepsy
- Physical and occupational therapy to improve mobility and coordination
- Speech therapy, including using alternative communication methods like sign language or communication devices
- Behavioral therapy
- Special education services tailored to individual needs

#### Clinical Trials and Studies
Clinical trials are an ongoing avenue for research into better understanding and treating Angelman Syndrome. Various organizations conduct studies, and information can be found through resources such as ClinicalTrials.gov and the Angelman Syndrome Foundation.
