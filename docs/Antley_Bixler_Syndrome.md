# Antley Bixler Syndrome
### Antley-Bixler Syndrome

#### Disease Overview
Antley-Bixler Syndrome (ABS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized primarily by craniosynostosis (premature fusion of certain skull bones) and skeletal abnormalities. In many cases, individuals may also have issues with genital or endocrine systems due to underlying genetic mutations affecting steroid metabolism. Facial abnormalities and limb malformations are also prevalent features of the condition.

#### Disease Category
- Genetic Disorders
- Congenital Disorders

#### Synonyms
- Trapezoidocephaly-syndactyly syndrome
- ABS

#### Signs & Symptoms
- Craniosynostosis: Early closure of skull sutures leading to an abnormal head shape.
- Midface hypoplasia: Underdevelopment of the middle facial features.
- Radiohumeral synostosis: Fusion of the radius and humerus bones at the elbow.
- Femoral bowing: Bowed thigh bones.
- Urogenital abnormalities: Ambiguous genitalia or congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
- Joint contractures: Stiffness of joints.
- Intellectual disability may occur in some cases.
- Additional indications can include bulging eyes, depressed nasal bridge, and ear abnormalities.

#### Causes
Antley-Bixler Syndrome is primarily caused by mutations in the FGFR2 gene or POR gene:
- FGFR2 gene mutations are related to the craniosynostosis and skeletal malformations.
- POR gene mutations affect steroid metabolism, contributing to genital and endocrine abnormalities.

#### Affected Populations
ABS affects both males and females and can be present in various ethnic groups. The exact incidence is unknown due to its rarity.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Crouzon syndrome: Another craniosynostosis syndrome but without the limb defects seen in ABS.
- Pfeiffer syndrome: Similar to ABS with craniosynostosis and limb abnormalities but distinct genetic causes.
- Apert syndrome: Characterized by craniosynostosis and severe syndactyly (webbing of fingers) but not typically associated with genital abnormalities.

#### Diagnosis
- Diagnostic imaging (CT or MRI) of the skull and skeleton to confirm craniosynostosis and bone anomalies.
- Genetic testing to identify mutations in the FGFR2 or POR genes.
- Hormonal assays to assess for endocrine abnormalities.

#### Standard Therapies
- Surgical interventions: Early surgery may be necessary to correct craniosynostosis and other skeletal anomalies.
- Hormonal therapy: May be required for endocrine system abnormalities.
- Regular monitoring and supportive care: Multidisciplinary follow-up involving craniofacial surgeons, endocrinologists, and orthopedic specialists.
- Genetic counseling: For families to understand the risk of recurrence and implications.

#### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Information not available. Families and healthcare providers are encouraged to check clinical trial registries and research institutions for ongoing studies.

#### Complete Report
A detailed report on Antley-Bixler Syndrome can be compiled from medical literature, genetic databases, and clinical resources. It would typically include an in-depth examination of the genetic underpinnings, case studies, and treatment outcomes to provide comprehensive insights into the syndrome.

If further assistance or specific literature is required, consulting a medical geneticist or healthcare professional with experience in rare congenital disorders is recommended.
