### Disease Overview


Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome (BRS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and various other physical abnormalities. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the ASXL3 gene.





### Disease Category


Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome is classified under genetic disorders, specifically those affecting intellectual and developmental functions.





### Synonyms


- ASXL3 disorder


- BRS





### Signs & Symptoms


Individuals with Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome may exhibit:


- Severe intellectual disability


- Developmental delays


- Hypotonia (low muscle tone)


- Feeding difficulties during infancy


- Distinctive facial features (e.g., arched eyebrows, downturned corners of the mouth)


- Autism spectrum disorder-related behaviors


- Sleep disturbances


- Seizures in some cases


- Growth retardation





### Causes


Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome is caused by mutations in the ASXL3 gene. The ASXL3 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in regulating gene expression and chromatin remodeling. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.





### Affected Populations


Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome can affect individuals of any ethnicity or gender. Because it is a rare condition, precise prevalence rates are not well established but it is thought to occur in fewer than 1 in 1 million individuals.





### Disorders with Similar Symptoms


- Rett syndrome


- Angelman syndrome


- Smith-Magenis syndrome


- Kleefstra syndrome





### Diagnosis


Diagnosis of Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome is typically based on:


- Clinical evaluation and identification of characteristic symptoms


- Genetic testing to identify mutations in the ASXL3 gene


- Family history assessment





### Standard Therapies


There is no cure for Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome, and treatment focuses on managing symptoms. Standard therapies include:


- Early intervention programs to address developmental delays


- Physical therapy to improve motor skills and hypotonia


- Speech and occupational therapy


- Specialized educational programs


- Management of feeding difficulties


- Medication and behavioral therapy for autism spectrum disorders and seizures


- Supportive care for sleep disturbances





### Clinical Trials and Studies


Information on clinical trials and studies specific to Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome can be found through:


- ClinicalTrials.gov


- Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD)


As of now, no specific clinical trials tailored exclusively to BRS are widely documented.
