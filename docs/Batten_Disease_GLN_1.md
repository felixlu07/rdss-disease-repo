# Batten Disease GLN 1
### Batten Disease CLN1 (Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses 1)

#### Disease Overview
Batten Disease CLN1, also known as Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis 1 (CLN1), is a rare, fatal, inherited disorder of the nervous system that typically begins in childhood. It is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the nervous system, leading to a decline in motor skills, seizures, and loss of vision, among other symptoms.

#### Disease Category
- **Category**: Neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders.

#### Synonyms
- Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (INCL)
- CLN1 disease
- Santavuori-Haltia disease

#### Signs & Symptoms
- **Early Signs**: Developmental delay typically becomes evident around 6 months to 2 years of age.
- **Progressive Symptoms**:
  - Seizures
  - Rapid deterioration of motor skills
  - Visual impairment leading to blindness
  - Behavioral changes
  - Loss of fine motor skills and speech
  - Muscle rigidity, clumsiness, and cognitive decline

#### Causes
- **Genetic Mutation**: Caused by mutations in the PPT1 gene.
- **Inheritance Pattern**: Autosomal recessive inheritance.

#### Affected Populations
- **Demographics**: Typically begins in infancy or early childhood. Both sexes can be affected equally.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Other forms of Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (NCL)
- Rett Syndrome
- Mitochondrial disorders
- Other lysosomal storage disorders

#### Diagnosis
- **Diagnostic Tests**:
  - Genetic testing to identify PPT1 gene mutation.
  - Enzyme assay for palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1) activity.
  - MRI of the brain showing typical patterns associated with CLN1.
  - Electroencephalography (EEG) to identify seizure patterns.
  - Visual evoked potentials (VEP) and ophthalmology exams to assess vision loss.

#### Standard Therapies
- **Symptomatic Treatment**:
  - Anti-seizure medications.
  - Physical and occupational therapy to help with motor skills.
  - Speech therapy.
  - Nutritional support and proper care to manage feeding difficulties.
- **Experimental Therapies**:
  - Gene therapy: Research is ongoing to determine the potential efficacy of gene therapy to correct the underlying genetic defect.
  - Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT).

#### Clinical Trials and Studies
Information on current clinical trials and studies can be obtained from clinical trial registries such as ClinicalTrials.gov. Researchers are continuously exploring novel therapeutic approaches, including gene therapy and novel drug candidates.
