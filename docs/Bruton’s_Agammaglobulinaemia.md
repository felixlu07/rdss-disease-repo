# Bruton’s Agammaglobulinaemia
Sure, here is a detailed report on Bruton’s Agammaglobulinaemia:

### Disease Overview
Bruton’s Agammaglobulinaemia, also known as X-linked Agammaglobulinaemia (XLA), is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence of gamma globulins (antibodies) in the blood. This condition leads to a severe reduction in the ability to fight infections.

### Disease Category
Primary Immunodeficiency Disease

### Synonyms
- X-linked Agammaglobulinaemia
- XLA
- Congenital Agammaglobulinaemia
- Bruton's Hypogammaglobulinemia
- Sex-linked Agammaglobulinaemia

### Signs & Symptoms
- Recurrent bacterial infections (e.g., pneumonia, ear infections, sinusitis)
- Infections often start after infancy (usually around 6 months of age) when maternal antibodies diminish
- Absence or severe reduction of B cells, which are responsible for producing antibodies
- Low or absent levels of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM)
- Chronic gastrointestinal infections and complications
- Inflammation and infection of the joints (arthritis)
- Infections of the central nervous system

### Causes
Bruton’s Agammaglobulinaemia is caused by mutations in the BTK (Bruton tyrosine kinase) gene, which is crucial for the development and maturation of B cells. This gene is located on the X chromosome, hence the disease is X-linked and primarily affects males.

### Affected Populations
- Predominantly affects males due to its X-linked inheritance.
- Symptoms typically manifest in early childhood, often between 6 months and 2 years of age.
- Incidence is estimated to be about 1 in 200,000 live births.

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)
- Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)
- Hyper IgM Syndrome
- Selective IgA Deficiency
- Chronic Granulomatous Disease
- Other forms of agammaglobulinaemia

### Diagnosis
- Flow cytometry to determine the number of B cells in the blood
- Serum immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, IgM)
- Genetic testing for mutations in the BTK gene
- Family history and clinical presentation are also considered

### Standard Therapies
- Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement therapy to provide the missing antibodies
- Antibiotics for treatment and prevention of infections
- Regular follow-ups with immunologists and other specialists
- Immunization with non-live vaccines

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Information not available. However, patients and caregivers are encouraged to check clinical trial registries such as ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing studies.
