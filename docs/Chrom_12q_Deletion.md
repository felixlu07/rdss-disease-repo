# Chrom 12q Deletion
### Chrom 12q Deletion

#### Disease Overview
Chrom 12q Deletion is a rare chromosomal disorder resulting from the deletion of a segment on the long arm (q) of chromosome 12. The size and location of the deletion can vary among affected individuals, leading to a broad spectrum of physical, intellectual, and developmental symptoms.

#### Disease Category
Genetic Disorders

#### Synonyms
- 12q Deletion Syndrome
- Del(12q) Syndrome
- Monosomy 12q
- Partial Deletion of Chromosome 12 Long Arm

#### Signs & Symptoms
The clinical presentation of Chrom 12q Deletion can vary widely depending on the specific portion of the chromosome that is deleted. Common symptoms may include:
- Developmental delays
- Intellectual disability
- Growth retardation
- Facial dysmorphism (e.g., widely spaced eyes, broad nasal bridge)
- Congenital heart defects
- Hypotonia (low muscle tone)
- Behavioral issues
- Speech and language difficulties
- Seizures

#### Causes
Chrom 12q Deletion typically occurs de novo, meaning it arises spontaneously during the formation of reproductive cells (egg or sperm) or early in embryonic development. In rare cases, it can be inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation (where a piece of chromosome 12 is rearranged but not deleted).

#### Affected Populations
The disorder can affect both males and females of all ethnic backgrounds. Due to its rarity, the exact prevalence is unknown.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
The clinical features of Chrom 12q Deletion may overlap with other genetic disorders, making differential diagnosis important. These conditions can include:
- Down syndrome (Trisomy 21)
- Smith-Magenis syndrome
- Williams syndrome
- DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome)

#### Diagnosis
Diagnosis typically involves:
- Detailed clinical evaluation and medical history
- Chromosomal analysis (karyotyping)
- Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
- Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) or whole exome sequencing

#### Standard Therapies
There is no cure for Chrom 12q Deletion, and treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving the quality of life. Standard therapies can include:
- Early intervention programs
- Special education services
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Speech therapy
- Medical management of heart defects, seizures, and other associated health issues
