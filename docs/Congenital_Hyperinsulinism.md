# Congenital Hyperinsulinism
### Congenital Hyperinsulinism

#### Disease Overview
Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an overproduction of insulin by the pancreas, leading to persistent hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This condition can cause significant health issues if not identified and managed early, including brain damage due to recurrent low blood sugar episodes. 

#### Disease Category
- **Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders**

#### Synonyms
- Persistent Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia of Infancy (PHHI)
- Nesidioblastosis
- Pancreatic Nesidioblastosis
- Familial Hyperinsulinism

#### Signs & Symptoms
- Severe and recurrent hypoglycemia in newborns and infants.
- Symptoms of hypoglycemia like jitteriness, lethargy, irritability, poor feeding, and seizures.
- Potential for developmental delays or brain damage if hypoglycemia is prolonged or recurrent.

#### Causes
- Genetic mutations affecting the regulation of insulin production.
- Most common mutations involve the genes: ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, HNF4A, and UCP2.
- There are two forms of CHI: diffuse (throughout the pancreas) and focal (localized area of the pancreas).

#### Affected Populations
- Most commonly affects neonates and infants, though symptoms can present at any age.
- Both males and females are equally affected.
- Incidence is higher in certain populations with high rates of consanguinity (praxis among relatives), such as among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish or Saudi Arabian descent.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Insulinoma (insulin-producing tumor)
- Congenital Glycosylation Disorders
- Ketotic Hypoglycemia
- Addisonâ€™s Disease 
- Other causes of hypoglycemia such as hormone deficiencies or metabolic disorders.

#### Diagnosis
- Blood tests showing low blood glucose levels with inappropriately high insulin levels.
- Genetic testing can identify causative mutations.
- Imaging studies (such as CT, MRI, or Positron Emission Tomography) or pancreatic biopsy may be needed to differentiate between focal and diffuse disease.
- Critical diagnostic lab evaluation during hypoglycemic episodes.

#### Standard Therapies
- **Medical Management**:
  - Initial treatment includes intravenous glucose to maintain normal blood sugar levels.
  - Medications like diazoxide, somatostatin analogs (octreotide), and nifedipine may be used to reduce insulin secretion.
  - Frequent feeding or feeding through a gastrostomy tube may be necessary.
  
- **Surgical Interventions**:
  - In cases where medical management is insufficient, partial or near-total pancreatectomy (removal of part of the pancreas) may be considered, especially in focal disease.

#### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research and clinical trials are aiming to find more effective treatments with fewer side effects.
- Clinical trials may be found on ClinicalTrials.gov and other registries.
- Research is focusing on the genetic mechanisms, new medications, and surgical techniques.
