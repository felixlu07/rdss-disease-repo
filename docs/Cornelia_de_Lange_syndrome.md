### Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS)

#### Disease Overview
Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and developmental delays. Individuals with CdLS may exhibit a wide range of physical and intellectual disabilities, varying from mild to severe.

#### Disease Category
CdLS falls under the category of congenital genetic disorders.

#### Synonyms
- CdLS
- Brachmann-de Lange Syndrome
- Amsterdam Dwarfism

#### Signs & Symptoms
The signs and symptoms of CdLS can vary widely but commonly include:
- Distinctive facial features (arched eyebrows, synophrys, long eyelashes, small upturned nose, thin downturned lips)
- Limb anomalies (shortening or absence of forearms, fingers, and toes)
- Growth delays (both pre- and postnatal)
- Intellectual disability and developmental delays
- Behavioral issues (autistic-like behaviors, self-injury)
- Gastrointestinal issues (reflux, constipation)
- Hearing and vision problems
- Congenital heart defects

#### Causes
CdLS is most often caused by mutations in the NIPBL gene, but mutations in other genes such as SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, and HDAC8 have also been associated with the syndrome. These genes are involved in the regulation of the cohesin complex, which is critical for chromosome structure and cell division.

#### Affected Populations
CdLS affects individuals of all ethnic backgrounds and both genders. It is estimated to occur in 1 in 10,000 to 30,000 live births.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
CdLS may present with features similar to other conditions such as:
- Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
- Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome
- Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome
- Coffin-Siris Syndrome

#### Diagnosis
Diagnosis of CdLS is primarily based on clinical findings and distinctive physical characteristics. Genetic testing can identify mutations in associated genes and confirm the diagnosis.

#### Standard Therapies
There is no cure for CdLS, and treatment is symptomatic and supportive:
- Regular monitoring and treatment for heart, dental, vision, and hearing issues
- Early intervention services including physical, occupational, and speech therapy
- Management of gastroesophageal reflux and other gastrointestinal issues
- Behavioral interventions and therapies to manage behavioral issues
