# Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy Type 2
### Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy Type 2

#### Disease Overview
Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy Type 2 (EDMD2), also known as autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, is a genetic disorder characterized by gradual muscle wasting and weakness, joint contractures, and heart problems. These symptoms typically appear in childhood or early adulthood.

#### Disease Category
EDMD2 falls under the category of Muscular Dystrophies, which are a group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration.

#### Synonyms
- AD-EDMD (Autosomal Dominant Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy)

#### Signs & Symptoms
The primary signs and symptoms of EDMD2 include:
- **Muscle Weakness**: Progressive weakness and atrophy, often beginning in the shoulders, upper arms, and lower legs.
- **Contractures**: Stiffness or tightening of the muscles and joints, particularly in the elbows, ankles, and neck.
- **Cardiomyopathy and Heart Conduction Defects**: May lead to arrhythmias, palpitations, and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.

Additional symptoms might include muscle pain, fatigue, and difficulty walking or maintaining posture.

#### Causes
EDMD2 is primarily caused by mutations in the LMNA gene, which provides instructions for making proteins that maintain the structure and function of the cellâ€™s nuclear envelope. This gene mutation is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning only one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the disorder.

#### Affected Populations
- **Gender**: Both males and females are affected equally.
- **Age**: Symptoms usually begin in childhood or early adulthood, but the age of onset can vary.
- **Prevalence**: Information not available.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
The symptoms of EDMD2 can be similar to other types of muscular dystrophy, including but not limited to:
- Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
- Becker Muscular Dystrophy
- Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy
- Congenital Muscular Dystrophy

#### Diagnosis
Diagnosis of EDMD2 typically involves a combination of:
- **Clinical Evaluation**: Assessment of symptoms and family history.
- **Genetic Testing**: Confirmatory tests to detect mutations in the LMNA gene.
- **Electromyography (EMG) and Muscle Biopsy**: To assess muscle health.
- **Cardiac Evaluation**: Including ECG and echocardiogram to identify heart problems.

#### Standard Therapies
- **Physical Therapy**: To manage muscle weakness and contractures.
- **Orthopedic Interventions**: Such as braces or surgery to manage joint contractures.
- **Cardiac Management**: Medications, pacemakers, or implantable defibrillators to monitor and correct heart arrhythmias.

There is currently no cure for EDMD2. The management is symptomatic and supportive, focusing on maintaining mobility and preventing complications.

#### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Information on ongoing clinical trials and studies can be found on repositories such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
- Participation in clinical trials may offer access to new treatments under investigation.
