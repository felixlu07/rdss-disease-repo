# Floating Harbour Syndrome
### Floating Harbour Syndrome

#### Disease Overview
Floating Harbour Syndrome (FHS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by short stature, delayed bone age, specific craniofacial features, and speech and language impairment. It was first described in the early 1970s by Pelletier and Feingold. The name "Floating Harbour Syndrome" originates from the Floating Hospital for Children in the USA and Harbour General Hospital in California, where affected individuals were first identified.

#### Disease Category
FHS falls under the category of genetic disorders.

#### Synonyms
- FHS
- Floating-Harbour Syndrome

#### Signs & Symptoms
The main characteristics of Floating Harbour Syndrome include:
- **Short stature**: Significant below-average height for age.
- **Distinctive craniofacial features**: These may include a triangular face, deep-set eyes, broad nasal bridge, wide mouth, and thin upper lip.
- **Delayed bone age**: Bones may develop slower than normal, often assessed through X-rays.
- **Speech and language delays**: Many affected children have significant speech and language issues.
- **Intellectual development**: Intellectual impairment is possible but varies widely among individuals.
- **Hearing loss**: Some patients may experience conductive hearing loss.
- Additionally, affected individuals may have gastrointestinal issues, heart defects, and skeletal abnormalities.

#### Causes
Floating Harbour Syndrome is caused by mutations in the SRCAP gene (SNF2-Related CREBBP Activator Protein). This gene plays a role in chromatin remodeling, which affects how DNA is packaged within the cell and influences gene expression. The mutations are typically de novo, meaning they are new and not inherited from either parent.

#### Affected Populations
FHS is an extremely rare condition with only about 50 reported cases in the medical literature, making it difficult to determine the exact prevalence. It affects males and females equally and has been reported in diverse geographic locations.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
FHS shares symptoms with several other conditions, making differential diagnosis important. These include:
- Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome
- Noonan syndrome
- Silver-Russell syndrome
- Cornelia de Lange syndrome

#### Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Floating Harbour Syndrome involves:
- **Clinical evaluation**: Assessment of physical and developmental traits.
- **Genetic testing**: Identification of mutations in the SRCAP gene confirms the diagnosis.
- **Radiographic imaging**: X-rays to assess delayed bone age.
- **Audiological evaluation**: Tests for hearing impairments.

#### Standard Therapies
Treatment for Floating Harbour Syndrome is symptomatic and supportive:
- **Growth hormone therapy**: May be considered for short stature.
- **Speech and language therapy**: To address communication issues.
- **Educational interventions**: Special education services tailored to the child's developmental needs.
- **Surgical interventions**: Corrective surgeries may be necessary for craniofacial or skeletal abnormalities.
- **Hearing aids**: For those with hearing impairment.
- **Regular follow-up**: Multidisciplinary healthcare team for ongoing assessment and management.

- Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD): Offers reliable information and support on rare diseases.

#### Complete Report
The information provided above gives a detailed overview of Floating Harbour Syndrome, covering essential aspects such as symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and treatment. Due to the rare nature of the syndrome, continuous research and patient-specific care are crucial for optimal management of the condition. Families are encouraged to seek support from specialized programs and maintain regular medical follow-up for their affected children.
