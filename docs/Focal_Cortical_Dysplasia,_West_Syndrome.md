# Focal Cortical Dysplasia, West Syndrome
### Disease Overview
**Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD)** is a congenital condition affecting a specific area of the brain's cerebral cortex, leading to epilepsy that is resistant to medical treatment. **West Syndrome** (WS), also known as infantile spasms, is a specific type of epilepsy syndrome that begins in infancy and is characterized by spasms, abnormal brain wave patterns called hypsarrhythmia, and developmental regression.

### Disease Category
- **Focal Cortical Dysplasia**: Neurological disorders, Epilepsy
- **West Syndrome**: Epilepsy syndromes (specifically infantile)

### Synonyms
- **Focal Cortical Dysplasia**: FCD, Cortical dysplasia
- **West Syndrome**: Infantile Spasms, Generalized Flexion Epilepsy, Hypsarrhythmia, X-linked Infantile Spasms (specific to some genetic cases)

### Signs & Symptoms
**Focal Cortical Dysplasia**:
- Recurrent seizures (epilepsy) that may begin at any age, often resistant to medication.
- Developmental delay.
- Neurological deficits depending on the brain region affected.

**West Syndrome**:
- Sudden, jerky movements known as spasms, usually occurring in clusters.
- Developmental regression or plateau.
- A characteristic EEG pattern known as hypsarrhythmia.
- Irritability or difficulty feeding (in infants).

### Causes
**Focal Cortical Dysplasia**:
- Abnormal migration and development of neurons in the brain during pregnancy.
- Specific genetic mutations (such as in the MTOR gene).

**West Syndrome**:
- Can be caused by various underlying conditions, including metabolic disorders, genetic syndromes like Tuberous Sclerosis, brain injury or malformations, and infections such as meningitis or encephalitis.
- Sometimes idiopathic, meaning the cause is unknown.

### Affected Populations
- **Focal Cortical Dysplasia**: Can affect individuals of any age but often diagnosed in children due to epilepsy onset.
- **West Syndrome**: Typically affects infants aged 3-12 months; can affect both genders and all races.

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
**Focal Cortical Dysplasia**:
- Tuberculous Sclerosis
- Sturge-Weber Syndrome
- Polymicrogyria
- Other forms of refractory epilepsy

**West Syndrome**:
- Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 
- Other causes of infantile spasms

### Diagnosis
- **Focal Cortical Dysplasia**: MRI scans may show abnormalities in the brain cortex, EEG to monitor seizure activity, genetic testing in some cases.
- **West Syndrome**: Diagnosis is based on the clinical triad of spasms, developmental regression, and characteristic EEG findings (hypsarrhythmia).

### Standard Therapies
**Focal Cortical Dysplasia**:
- Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), though often refractory.
- Surgical resection of the dysplastic area of the brain when the seizures cannot be controlled with medication.
- Ketogenic diet or Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) in some cases.

**West Syndrome**:
- ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) therapy.
- Oral corticosteroids like prednisone.
- Anti-epileptic drugs such as vigabatrin.
- Supportive therapies including physical and occupational therapy.

### Complete Report
This information synthesizes the currently available knowledge on Focal Cortical Dysplasia and West Syndrome. Both conditions cause significant neurological impact primarily through epilepsy and developmental delays. Despite sharing a common symptom of seizures, they have distinct causes, diagnostic criteria, and therapeutic approaches. Continued research and clinical trials are essential for better understanding and management of these challenging neurological conditions. For more in-depth study and patient support, various epilepsy foundations and neurological societies offer resources and assistance.
