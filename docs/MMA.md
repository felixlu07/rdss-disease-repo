# MMA
Sure, I can provide detailed information about the disease known as MMA (Methylmalonic Acidemia).

### Disease Overview
Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA) is a rare genetic disorder in which the body cannot break down certain proteins and fats. This leads to a buildup of methylmalonic acid in the blood and tissues, which can cause serious health problems, including developmental delays and organ damage.

### Disease Category
- **Category:** Genetic Disorders / Metabolic Disorders

### Synonyms
- Methylmalonic Aciduria
- MMA

### Signs & Symptoms
- Vomiting
- Dehydration
- Hypotonia (low muscle tone)
- Lethargy (lack of energy)
- Developmental delays
- Seizures
- Chronic kidney disease
- Enlarged liver (hepatomegaly)

### Causes
Methylmalonic Acidemia is typically caused by mutations in the MUT gene or other genes (such as MMAA, MMAB, MMADHC) that are important for the normal metabolism of certain proteins and fats. These genetic mutations lead to a deficiency of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which is crucial for metabolizing certain amino acids and fats.

### Affected Populations
Methylmalonic Acidemia can affect individuals of all genders and ethnic backgrounds. It is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood but can present later depending on the severity of the enzyme deficiency.

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Propionic Acidemia
- Isovaleric Acidemia
- Maple Syrup Urine Disease
- Multiple Carboxylase Deficiency
- Organic Acidurias

### Diagnosis
The diagnosis of MMA can be confirmed through various tests, including:
- Newborn screening (heel prick test)
- Blood and urine organic acid analysis
- Genetic testing to identify mutations in the related genes
- Enzyme activity assays to measure the activity of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase

### Standard Therapies
- **Dietary Management:** A diet low in certain proteins (low in methionine, threonine, valine, and isoleucine) to reduce the production of methylmalonic acid.
- **Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) supplementation:** Some forms of MMA respond to high doses of vitamin B12.
- **Medications:** Carnitine supplements to help remove harmful substances from the body.
- **Liver or Kidney Transplantation:** In severe cases, organ transplantation may be considered.

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Clinical trials and research studies are ongoing to find better treatments and understand the genetic basis of MMA. Patients and families can participate in these studies to help advance scientific knowledge and treatment options.

### Complete Report
This detailed overview of Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA) serves as a foundational summary of this rare genetic and metabolic disorder. For the most accurate and comprehensive understanding, it is recommended to consult healthcare professionals, genetic counselors, and specialized medical literature. Continued research and clinical trials are essential in advancing care and treatment.

If you need more specific information or have further questions, consulting a healthcare provider or genetic specialist is highly recommended.
