### May-Thurner Syndrome

#### Disease Overview
May-Thurner Syndrome (MTS) is a vascular condition in which the right iliac artery compresses the left iliac vein against the lumbar spine. This pressure can lead to the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), primarily in the left leg, due to restricted blood flow. The condition is primarily diagnosed in young to middle-aged women but can occur in men as well.

#### Disease Category
Vascular Disorder

#### Synonyms
- Iliac Vein Compression Syndrome
- Cockett Syndrome

#### Signs & Symptoms
- Swelling in the left leg
- Pain in the left leg, which may worsen while standing
- Varicose veins in the affected leg
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
- Venous ulcers (in severe cases)
- Feeling of heaviness in the leg

#### Causes
May-Thurner Syndrome occurs due to anatomical compression, where the right iliac artery compresses the left iliac vein against the spine. This compression may cause damage to the veinâ€™s inner walls, leading to blood clots. The exact reason why this anatomical configuration leads to problems in some individuals but remains asymptomatic in others is not entirely understood.

#### Affected Populations
- Predominantly affects young adults between 20 and 40 years of age
- More common in women than men
- Increased risk for individuals with sedentary lifestyles

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to other causes
- Chronic venous insufficiency
- Post-thrombotic syndrome
- Lymphedema

#### Diagnosis
- **Ultrasound/Doppler Studies:** To visualize blood flow in the veins and identify any obstructions
- **Venography:** A more invasive imaging technique using contrast dye to get detailed images of the veins
- **MRI or CT Scans:** Advanced imaging techniques that provide detailed pictures of the veins and arteries
- **Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS):** An imaging technique using a special ultrasound catheter to visualize inside the blood vessels

#### Standard Therapies
- **Conservative Management:**
  - Compression stockings to reduce swelling
  - Elevation of the affected leg
  - Anticoagulant medications to prevent or treat DVT
- **Endovascular Treatments:**
  - **Angioplasty and Stenting:** Inserting a balloon to widen the vein and placing a stent to keep it open
- **Surgical Interventions:**
  - In severe cases, surgery may be required to move the artery or bypass the compressed segment

#### Complete Report
May-Thurner Syndrome is a condition characterized by the compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery, potentially leading to deep vein thrombosis. It predominantly affects young to middle-aged women but can also occur in men. Symptoms include swelling and pain in the left leg, varicose veins, and in severe cases, venous ulcers. Diagnosis involves imaging studies like ultrasound, venography, MRI, or CT scans, and intravascular ultrasound. Standard treatments range from conservative measures like compression stockings and anticoagulants to interventional procedures such as angioplasty, stenting, or surgery.
