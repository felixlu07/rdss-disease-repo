# Menkess Disease
### Menkes Disease

#### Disease Overview
Menkes disease, also known as Menkes syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by defective copper metabolism. It primarily affects the development of the nervous system and connective tissue, leading to severe developmental delays, intellectual disability, and distinctive physical abnormalities. This disease is usually fatal in early childhood.

#### Disease Category
Menkes disease falls under the category of **genetic metabolic disorders**.

#### Synonyms
- Menkes Syndrome
- Menkes Kinky Hair Disease
- Steely Hair Disease
- Trichopoliodystrophy

#### Signs & Symptoms
- **Neurological issues**: Severe developmental delays, seizures, hypotonia (reduced muscle tone), and neurodegeneration.
- **Connective tissue disorders**: Loose skin and joints.
- **Hair abnormalities**: Sparse, kinky, brittle hair.
- **Growth issues**: Failure to thrive and poor growth.
- **Facial features**: Sagging facial skin, hernias, and other connective tissue abnormalities.
- **Other symptoms**: Hypopigmentation, temperature instability, and vascular complications.

#### Causes
Menkes disease is caused by mutations in the **ATP7A gene** located on the X chromosome. This gene is responsible for coding a protein that regulates copper levels in the body. Malfunction or absence of this protein disrupts copper absorption and distribution, leading to the symptoms of Menkes disease.

#### Affected Populations
Menkes disease primarily affects males due to its X-linked inheritance pattern. Females can be carriers and may exhibit mild symptoms, but usually do not have the full-blown disease. The condition is extremely rare, affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 to 250,000 newborns worldwide.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome**: A group of connective tissue disorders.
- **Wilsonâ€™s Disease**: A disorder leading to copper accumulation in the tissues.
- **Occipital Horn Syndrome**: Also caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene, but generally milder.
- **Trichothiodystrophy**: Characterized by brittle hair and skin abnormalities.

#### Diagnosis
- **Clinical evaluation**: Based on physical symptoms such as hair and skin abnormalities along with neurological deficits.
- **Biochemical tests**: Blood and urine tests for copper and ceruloplasmin levels.
- **Genetic testing**: Identification of mutations in the ATP7A gene confirms the diagnosis.
- **Imaging**: MRI scans of the brain may show characteristic changes associated with the disease.

#### Standard Therapies
- **Early copper supplementation**: Subcutaneous injections of copper histidine or copper chloride. Effectiveness is variable and typically greater if started early.
- **Symptomatic treatment**: Seizure management, nutritional support, and physical therapy.
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involving neurologists, geneticists, nutritionists, and other specialists.

#### Clinical Trials and Studies
Clinical trials are ongoing to better understand the pathophysiology and potential treatments for Menkes disease. Information on current clinical trials can be found on platforms such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
