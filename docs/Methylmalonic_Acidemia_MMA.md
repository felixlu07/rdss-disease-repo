# Methylmalonic Acidemia MMA
### Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA) Overview
Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder where the body cannot correctly process certain lipids (fats) and proteins. This results in the accumulation of methylmalonic acid in the body, which can lead to a variety of serious health problems.

### Disease Category
MMA is classified under metabolic disorders, specifically within the group of organic acidemias.

### Synonyms
- Methylmalonic Aciduria
- MMA

### Signs & Symptoms
Symptoms can vary widely in severity and may appear in infancy, childhood, or adulthood. 
- Vomiting
- Dehydration
- Difficulty breathing
- Lethargy
- Hypotonia (low muscle tone)
- Developmental delays
- Intellectual disability
- Failure to thrive
- Seizures
- Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver)
- Renal failure

### Causes
MMA is primarily caused by mutations in the genes necessary for the proper breakdown of certain proteins and fats. These genes include MUT, MMAA, MMAB, MMADHC, and MCEE. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

### Affected Populations
MMA affects both males and females equally. The exact prevalence is not well-documented but it is considered very rare, with varying incidence rates among different populations. It is more frequently diagnosed in populations with high rates of consanguinity.

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Propionic Acidemia
- Isovaleric Acidemia
- Maple Syrup Urine Disease
- Urea Cycle Disorders
- Phenylketonuria (PKU)
- Glutaric Acidemia Type I and Type II

### Diagnosis
- Newborn Screening: Can detect elevated levels of methylmalonic acid.
- Blood and urine tests: Can confirm elevated levels of methylmalonic acid.
- Genetic Testing: Can identify mutations in specific genes to confirm the diagnosis.
- Imaging Tests: MRI or CT scans to assess brain and organ damage.

### Standard Therapies
- **Dietary Management:** A low-protein, high-carbohydrate diet may help reduce the production of methylmalonic acid.
- **Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin):** Some forms of MMA can respond to Vitamin B12 supplementation.
- **Pharmaceutical Treatments:** Oral or intravenous antibiotics to reduce the gut bacteria that produce propionate.
- **Liver and/or Kidney Transplantation:** In severe cases, liver and/or kidney transplantation may be considered.
  
### Clinical Trials and Studies
There are ongoing clinical trials and studies aimed at developing new treatments and understanding the genetic and biochemical underpinnings of MMA. These can be found on databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

### Programs & Resources
- **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD):** Provides information on genetic and rare diseases.
- **National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD):** Offers support and information for those affected by rare diseases.
- **Organic Acidemia Association:** Provides support and information to families and patients affected by organic acidemia disorders, including MMA.

### Complete Report
Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA) is a rare inherited disorder leading to the accumulation of methylmalonic acid due to the body's inability to properly process certain fats and proteins. Symptoms range from vomiting and lethargy to severe organ damage. It is primarily caused by mutations in specific genes and is inherited autosomal recessively. Diagnosis involves genetic testing and measurement of methylmalonic acid levels. Management includes dietary changes, Vitamin B12 supplementation, and in severe cases, organ transplantation. Ongoing research and support from organizations like GARD and NORD continue to provide hope and resources to affected individuals.
