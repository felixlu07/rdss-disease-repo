# Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI)
### Disease Overview
Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI), also known as Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome, is a rare inherited metabolic disorder. It falls under the category of lysosomal storage diseases and is characterized by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase B, also known as N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase. This enzyme deficiency leads to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in tissues and organs, causing a wide range of clinical symptoms.

### Disease Category
MPS VI is classified as a lysosomal storage disorder, which is a subgroup of metabolic disorders.

### Synonyms
- Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome
- Polydystrophic Dwarfism
- MPS 6

### Signs & Symptoms
The signs and symptoms of MPS VI can vary widely in severity and may include:
- Skeletal abnormalities such as dysostosis multiplex
- Short stature and growth retardation
- Joint stiffness and pain
- Coarse facial features
- Corneal clouding
- Enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly)
- Cardiac issues, including heart valve abnormalities
- Respiratory problems
- Hernias
- Hearing loss

### Causes
MPS VI is caused by mutations in the ARSB gene, which provides instructions for producing the enzyme arylsulfatase B. These mutations result in reduced or absent activity of the enzyme, leading to the accumulation of GAGs in cells, particularly in the lysosomes, causing progressive damage.

### Affected Populations
MPS VI can affect individuals of any ethnic background. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that two copies of the mutated gene are required for a person to be affected. The prevalence of MPS VI is estimated to be between 1 in 250,000 to 1 in 600,000 in the general population.

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
MPS VI shares overlapping symptoms with other types of mucopolysaccharidoses and other lysosomal storage disorders, such as:
- Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (Hurler syndrome)
- Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (Hunter syndrome)
- Mucopolysaccharidosis type IV (Morquio syndrome)
- Mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (Sly syndrome)
These conditions may exhibit similar clinical features, making differential diagnosis important.

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis of MPS VI involves several steps:
1. Clinical evaluation based on signs and symptoms.
2. Urine test to detect elevated levels of dermatan sulfate.
3. Enzyme assay to measure arylsulfatase B activity in blood leukocytes or fibroblasts.
4. Molecular genetic testing to identify mutations in the ARSB gene.

### Standard Therapies
The treatment options for MPS VI include:
- Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT): Recombinant human arylsulfatase B (galsulfase, commercial name Naglazyme) to supplement the deficient enzyme and reduce GAG storage.
- Symptomatic and supportive treatments: Management of heart and respiratory problems, physical therapy for joint stiffness, orthopedic surgeries for skeletal abnormalities, hearing aids for hearing loss, and regular monitoring of organ function.
- Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): Considered in selected cases, although it carries significant risk and is less commonly used.

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Ongoing research and clinical trials aim to explore new treatments and improve existing ones for MPS VI. These may include enhancing ERT effectiveness, gene therapy approaches, and investigating small molecule treatments. Detailed information on current clinical trials is available through databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

### Programs & Resources
There are several resources and support programs for patients with MPS VI and their families, including:
- National MPS Society
- International MPS Network
- Global Genes
- National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)
These organizations provide educational materials, support networks, advocacy, and information on financial assistance.

### Complete Report
Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the ARSB gene, leading to a deficiency in arylsulfatase B enzyme activity. This enzyme deficiency results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as dermatan sulfate, causing a wide spectrum of symptoms including skeletal abnormalities, short stature, cardiac issues, and respiratory complications. Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical evaluation, urine tests, enzyme activity assays, and genetic testing. The mainstay of treatment is Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) with galsulfase, alongside supportive care to manage symptoms. Various organizations and support networks provide resources for affected individuals and their families. Ongoing research and clinical trials continue to seek improved therapies for MPS VI.
