# Neuphrotic Syndrome
Sure, here is the detailed information about Nephrotic Syndrome in the requested format:

### Disease Overview
Nephrotic Syndrome is a kidney disorder that causes the body to excrete too much protein in the urine. It's primarily due to damage to the clusters of small blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess water from the blood.

### Disease Category
Nephrotic Syndrome is categorized under kidney diseases, specifically glomerular diseases.

### Synonyms
- Nephrosis

### Signs & Symptoms
- Severe swelling (edema) around the eyes and in the ankles and feet
- Foamy urine, which may indicate protein in the urine
- Weight gain due to excess fluid retention
- Fatigue
- Loss of appetite

### Causes
The condition can be caused by:
- Primary kidney diseases like Minimal Change Disease (MCD), Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and Membranous Nephropathy
- Systemic diseases such as diabetes and lupus
- Infections, certain medications, and more rare genetic disorders

### Affected Populations
Nephrotic syndrome can affect individuals of any age, gender, or ethnicity, though it is more commonly diagnosed in children, particularly those between the ages of 2 and 6.

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Acute Glomerulonephritis
- Chronic Kidney Disease
- Hepatic Cirrhosis
- Congestive Heart Failure

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis typically involves:
- Urine tests (urinalysis) to detect high levels of protein
- Blood tests to assess levels of albumin and cholesterol
- Kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis
- Imaging tests like ultrasound to view the kidneys

### Standard Therapies
Treatment objectives include reducing symptoms, preventing complications, and treating the underlying cause, which may involve:
- Medications such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants
- Diuretics to reduce swelling
- ACE inhibitors and ARBs to lower blood pressure and reduce protein loss
- Low-sodium diet and limited fluid intake

### Clinical Trials and Studies

### Complete Report
Nephrotic Syndrome is a significant health condition affecting the kidney's filtering units, leading to protein loss in the urine. It is crucial to diagnose and manage the condition properly to avoid severe complications. While it prominently affects young children, it remains a lifelong concern that requires diligent medical care and lifestyle adjustments. Research and clinical trials are ongoing to find better treatment options, and multiple resources are available to support affected individuals.
