# Neurofibromatosis Type I
- **Disease Overview**  
  Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple benign tumors of nerves and skin (neurofibromas) and areas of abnormal pigmentation (café-au-lait spots). It is one of the most common neurological genetic disorders and can affect multiple systems of the body.

- **Disease Category**  
  NF1 falls under the category of genetic neurological disorders and is part of a group of conditions known as phakomatoses.

- **Synonyms**  
  - Peripheral Neurofibromatosis
  - Recklinghausen Disease
  - Von Recklinghausen Neurofibromatosis

- **Signs & Symptoms**  
  The signs and symptoms of NF1 vary widely among individuals but commonly include:
  - Multiple café-au-lait spots
  - Freckles in unusual places (like the armpits or groin)
  - Lisch nodules (tiny, non-cancerous tumors on the iris of the eye)
  - Neurofibromas (benign tumors on or under the skin)
  - Bone deformities, such as scoliosis
  - Learning disabilities
  - Other neurological problems, including seizures in some cases

- **Causes**  
  NF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, which is responsible for the production of neurofibromin, a protein that helps regulate cell growth. A defective NF1 gene leads to the uncontrolled growth of cells, resulting in tumors.

- **Affected Populations**  
  NF1 affects all racial and ethnic groups and is equally common in males and females. It is estimated to occur in about 1 in 3,000 to 4,000 live births.

- **Disorders with Similar Symptoms**  
  Several conditions can present symptoms similar to those seen in NF1, including:
  - Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2)
  - Legius syndrome
  - Schwannomatosis
  - McCune-Albright syndrome

- **Diagnosis**  
  Diagnosis of NF1 is primarily clinical, based on specific criteria including:
  - Presence of multiple café-au-lait spots
  - Two or more neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma
  - Freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions
  - Optic glioma
  - Two or more Lisch nodules
  - A distinctive bony lesion
  - A first-degree relative with NF1

  Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis, especially in uncertain cases.

- **Standard Therapies**  
  While there is no cure for NF1, treatment focuses on managing symptoms:
  - Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider
  - Surgical removal of problematic tumors
  - Management of complications such as orthopedic problems
  - Educational support for learning disabilities
  - Pain management strategies

- **Clinical Trials and Studies**  
  Clinical trials and studies are ongoing to find better treatments and understand the disease better. Individuals with NF1 can participate in these studies to help advance scientific research. Information on current clinical trials can be found through resources such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
