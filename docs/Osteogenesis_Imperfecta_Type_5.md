# Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type 5
### Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type 5

#### Disease Overview
Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) Type 5 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by moderate to severe bone fragility, distinct clinical and radiographic features, and hyperplastic callus formation following fractures. It represents a unique type of OI which is distinct from other types described in terms of genetic cause and clinical presentation.

#### Disease Category
Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type 5 falls under the category of genetic bone disorders and specifically under the broader category of Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which is known as brittle bone disease.

#### Synonyms
- OI Type V
- Osteogenesis Imperfecta V

#### Signs & Symptoms
- Moderate to severe bone fragility leading to frequent fractures
- Hyperplastic callus formation (excessive bone healing) following fractures
- Calcification of interosseous membrane, particularly in the forearms
- Normal sclerae color (in contrast with other types of OI which may present blue sclerae)
- Variable reduction in bone mass (osteopenia)
- Delayed tooth eruption and dentinogenesis imperfecta are less commonly seen

#### Causes
Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type 5 is caused by a mutation in the IFITM5 gene. This mutation leads to the production of an abnormal protein that affects bone formation and quality. 

#### Affected Populations
OI Type 5 affects both males and females and can be diagnosed in various populations around the world. The prevalence of this specific type is not well-documented, but overall, OI has an estimated incidence of 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 20,000 live births.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Osteogenesis Imperfecta Types 1-4 and Types 6-8
- Other genetic bone disorders such as Hypophosphatasia and Type I Collagen disorders
- Conditions leading to secondary osteoporosis with multiple fractures (e.g., certain metabolic bone diseases and chronic use of corticosteroids)

#### Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type 5 involves:
- Clinical evaluation noting history of frequent fractures and characteristic bone features
- Genetic testing to identify mutations in the IFITM5 gene
- Radiographic imaging revealing hyperplastic callus formation and other distinct skeletal anomalies

#### Standard Therapies
- **Medical Management:**
  - Bisphosphonates to increase bone density and reduce fracture risk
  - Pain management strategies including medication and physical therapy
- **Surgical Interventions:**
  - Intramedullary rodding to stabilize long bones and prevent fractures
  - Orthopedic surgery for fracture repair and correction of bone deformities
- **Supportive Therapies:**
  - Physical therapy for muscle strengthening and mobility
  - Occupational therapy for achieving daily life functionality
  - Use of orthopedic devices such as braces and wheelchairs
