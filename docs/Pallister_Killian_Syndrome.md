# Pallister Killian Syndrome
Sure, here is detailed information on Pallister-Killian Syndrome (PKS) in the requested format:

### Disease Overview
Pallister-Killian Syndrome (PKS) is a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by various congenital abnormalities and developmental delays. PKS is a mosaic condition resulting from the presence of an extra isochromosome 12p, meaning there are four copies of the short arm (p) of chromosome 12 in some cells instead of the normal two.

### Disease Category
Genetic Disorder

### Synonyms
- Tetrasomy 12p Mosaicism
- Mosaic Tetrasomy 12p Syndrome
- Pallister Mosaic Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
The severity and range of symptoms can vary significantly but often include:
- Developmental delays and intellectual disability
- Hypotonia (poor muscle tone)
- Characteristic facial features such as a high forehead, sparse scalp hair (especially at birth), broad and flat nose, and a short neck
- Pigmentary skin anomalies, including areas of lighter or darker skin (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation)
- Seizures
- Hearing loss
- Vision problems
- Congenital heart defects
- Skeletal abnormalities, such as extra fingers or toes (polydactyly)

### Causes
PKS is caused by the presence of an extra isochromosome composed of two short arms of chromosome 12 in a mosaic pattern. The extra isochromosome 12p originates randomly and usually not inherited from the parents.

### Affected Populations
Pallister-Killian Syndrome can affect individuals of any gender or ethnic background. Its exact prevalence is unknown, but it is considered a rare disorder.

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
The symptoms of PKS might be similar to other genetic disorders such as:
- Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)
- Smith-Magenis Syndrome
- Angelman Syndrome
- Prader-Willi Syndrome

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis can be complex due to the mosaic nature of the condition. Techniques that may be used include:
- Karyotyping: to identify the presence of the extra isochromosome 12p.
- Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH): a more precise method that can detect low levels of mosaicism.
- Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA): to identify chromosomal abnormalities at a higher resolution.

### Standard Therapies
As there is no cure for PKS, treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life through:
- Early intervention programs and special education
- Physical therapy to improve muscle tone and coordination
- Speech and occupational therapy
- Regular monitoring and treatment of hearing and vision problems
- Medications for seizure management
- Surgery for congenital heart defects and skeletal abnormalities if necessary

### Complete Report
Pallister-Killian Syndrome (PKS) is a rare chromosomal mosaicism disorder characterized by the presence of an extra isochromosome 12p. This disorder leads to a range of physical abnormalities and intellectual disabilities including developmental delays, distinctive facial features, hypotonia, skin pigmentary anomalies, seizures, hearing, and vision problems, among others. PKS affects any gender and ethnic background, with no known prevalence due to its rarity. Diagnosis is challenging due to the mosaic nature and typically involves karyotyping, FISH, or CMA. Standard treatment is symptomatic and supportive, involving various therapies and medical interventions tailored to the individual's needs. Information on clinical trials, references, and resources is not available at this time.
