# Patau Syndrome
### Patau Syndrome Detailed Information

#### Disease Overview
Patau Syndrome, also known as Trisomy 13, is a chromosomal condition that is associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Most cases of Patau Syndrome result from having an extra copy of chromosome 13 in the cells of the body. Due to the complexity and severity of the condition, it is often fatal early in life.

#### Disease Category
- Genetic/Chromosomal Disorder

#### Synonyms
- Trisomy 13
- Trisomy D
- Full Trisomy 13
- Partial Trisomy 13
- Mosaic Trisomy 13

#### Signs & Symptoms
- Intellectual disability
- Microcephaly (small head)
- Heart defects (e.g., ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus)
- Cleft lip and/or palate
- Microphthalmia (small eyes) or anophthalmia (absence of one or both eyes)
- Polydactyly (extra fingers or toes)
- Omphalocele (intestines outside the body at birth)
- Nervous system abnormalities
- Severe developmental delays
- Low birth weight
- Seizures
- Hearing loss

#### Causes
- Presence of an extra chromosome 13 (Trisomy 13), typically as the result of nondisjunction during the formation of reproductive cells in one of the parents.
- Less commonly, Patau Syndrome may be caused by a Robertsonian translocation or mosaicism.

#### Affected Populations
- The incidence of Patau Syndrome is approximately 1 in 10,000-16,000 live births.
- The condition affects males and females equally.
- The risk of having a baby with Patau Syndrome increases with maternal age.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Edwards Syndrome (Trisomy 18)
- Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)
- Other genetic conditions with developmental and intellectual disability

#### Diagnosis
- Prenatal screening through ultrasound and blood tests.
- Confirmatory testing through:
  - Amniocentesis
  - Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)
  - Chromosomal analysis (karyotyping)
- Postnatal diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and chromosomal analysis of blood samples.

#### Standard Therapies
- No cure; treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
- Management of feeding difficulties, seizures, and heart defects.
- Surgical interventions if feasible for cleft lip/palate and other anatomical abnormalities.
- Palliative care to improve quality of life and comfort.
- Multidisciplinary care team approach is often necessary, involving pediatricians, cardiologists, neurologists, and other specialists.

#### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Information not available.

#### References
- Information not available.

#### Programs & Resources
- Support groups and organizations such as the Patau Syndrome Foundation, National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), and March of Dimes.
- Genetic counseling for families affected by or at risk of Patau Syndrome.

#### Complete Report
Patau Syndrome, or Trisomy 13, is a severe chromosomal disorder characterized by intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies. It is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 13 and primarily affects newborns, often leading to early mortality. Affected individuals exhibit a wide range of symptoms, including heart defects, cleft palate, and growth retardation. Diagnosis is commonly made prenatally through screening and confirmed via chromosomal analysis. While there is no cure, treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life, often requiring a multidisciplinary medical approach. Access to resources and support groups is crucial for affected families, though the rarity of the condition poses challenges in comprehensive research and clinical trials.
