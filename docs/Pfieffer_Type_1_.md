# Pfieffer Type 1 
### Pfieffer Type 1 Disease

#### Disease Overview
Pfeiffer syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis), which affects the shape of the head and face. It also involves anomalies of the hands and feet. Type 1, also known as "classic" Pfeiffer syndrome, is the mildest form of the disease.

#### Disease Category
Genetic Disorder, Craniofacial Syndrome

#### Synonyms
- Classic Pfeiffer Syndrome
- Pfeiffer Syndrome Type 1

#### Signs & Symptoms
- Craniosynostosis: premature fusion of the skull bones leading to an abnormal shape of the head.
- Midface hypoplasia: underdevelopment of the central part of the face.
- Broad and short thumbs and big toes (brachydactyly).
- Partial soft tissue syndactyly: webbing or fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes.
- Normal to mildly delayed cognitive development.

#### Causes
Pfeiffer syndrome Type 1 is caused by mutations in either the FGFR1 or FGFR2 gene. These genes are responsible for the growth and development of bone and other tissues.

#### Affected Populations
Pfeiffer syndrome Type 1 affects both males and females equally. It occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 births.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Apert Syndrome
- Crouzon Syndrome
- Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome
- Jackson-Weiss Syndrome
- Muenke Syndrome

#### Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Pfeiffer syndrome Type 1 is typically based on a combination of:
- Clinical evaluation and physical examination.
- Radiographic imaging to observe cranial abnormalities.
- Genetic testing to identify mutations in the FGFR1 or FGFR2 gene.

#### Standard Therapies
- **Surgical intervention:** To correct cranial anomalies and prevent potential complications related to brain growth.
- **Reconstructive surgery:** For midface hypoplasia and syndactyly.
- **Monitoring and supportive care:** Continuous monitoring of developmental progress. Therapy might include physical and occupational therapy to assist with motor skills and other functional impairments.
