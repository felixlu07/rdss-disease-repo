# Rett Syndrome

**Disease Overview:**
Rett syndrome is a rare genetic neurological and developmental disorder that affects the way the brain develops. It results in severe cognitive and physical disabilities that become apparent after an initial period of normal development.

**Disease Category:**
Neurological disorder

**Synonyms:**
- RTT
- Autism-dementia-ataxia-loss of purposeful hand use syndrome

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Loss of purposeful hand skills (e.g., hand-wringing, washing, clapping)
- Loss of speech
- Cognitive disabilities
- Seizures
- Slowed growth
- Gait abnormalities
- Breathing irregularities

**Causes:**
Rett syndrome is most often caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. This gene plays a crucial role in the normal functioning of nerve cells.

**Affected Populations:**
Rett syndrome primarily affects females. It is estimated to occur in 1 in every 10,000 to 15,000 female births. Males with the condition typically have more severe forms and often do not survive infancy.

**Disorders with Similar Symptoms:**
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Angelman syndrome
- Cerebral palsy
- Childhood disintegrative disorder

**Diagnosis:**
Diagnosis of Rett syndrome is primarily clinical, based on observed signs and symptoms, but is confirmed with genetic testing for mutations in the MECP2 gene. Diagnostic criteria also involve ruling out other disorders with similar symptoms.

**Standard Therapies:**
- Symptomatic treatment includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and anticonvulsant medications for seizures.
- Nutritional support and strategies for improving mobility and communication are also critical.
- There is no cure for Rett syndrome, and treatment focuses on improving quality of life.

**Clinical Trials and Studies:**
Current clinical trials and studies are exploring various potential treatments, including gene therapy, novel pharmacological agents, and interventions aimed at symptom management. For the most up-to-date information, clinical trial registries should be consulted.

**Complete Report:**
Rett syndrome is a rare genetic disorder primarily affecting females and characterized by severe disabilities in cognition and physical function due to mutations in the MECP2 gene. Symptoms such as loss of hand skills, speech, seizures, and gait abnormalities become evident after initial normal development. Diagnosis is clinical, supplemented by genetic testing. Though there is no cure, symptomatic treatment and supportive therapies are crucial for managing the condition. Ongoing research and clinical trials are exploring new potential treatments and therapies to improve the quality of life for those affected by Rett syndrome. For more information, resources such as the International Rett Syndrome Foundation provide support and updates on the latest research.
