# Rubinstein Taybi syndrome

**Disease Overview:**
Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by broad thumbs and toes, distinctive facial features, and varying degrees of intellectual disability.

**Disease Category:**
Genetic Disorder

**Synonyms:**
- Broad Thumb-Hallux Syndrome
- Rubinstein Syndrome

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Broad, angulated thumbs and big toes
- Distinctive facial features, including a beaked nose and eye abnormalities
- Short stature
- Developmental delays
- Intellectual disability
- Feeding difficulties in infancy
- Increased risk of tumors

**Causes:**
Mutations in the CREBBP or EP300 gene are the primary causes of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that regulate gene activity and play essential roles in the development of various body tissues.

**Affected Populations:**
RTS affects both males and females. The incidence is estimated to be between 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 125,000 live births.

**Disorders with Similar Symptoms:**
- Floating-Harbor syndrome
- Cornelia de Lange syndrome
- Coffin-Siris syndrome
- Dubowitz syndrome
- KBG syndrome

**Diagnosis:**
Diagnosis primarily involves clinical evaluation based on physical characteristics and confirmation through genetic testing to identify mutations in the CREBBP or EP300 genes.

**Standard Therapies:**
- **Medical treatment:** Management of associated medical conditions such as heart defects, feeding difficulties, and eye abnormalities.
- **Therapeutic treatment:** Physical, occupational, and speech therapy to improve development and skills.
