# SMA Typ 1

**Disease Overview:**
Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 (SMA Type 1) is a genetic disorder characterized by the loss of motor neurons, which leads to progressive muscle wasting and weakness.

**Disease Category:**
Neuromuscular Disorder

**Synonyms:**
- Werdnig-Hoffmann disease
- SMA Type I
- Infantile-onset SMA

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Severe muscle weakness
- Poor muscle tone (hypotonia)
- Lack of motor development
- Difficulty breathing and feeding
- Tongue fasciculations (twitching)
- Scoliosis (curvature of the spine), in some cases

**Causes:**
SMA Type 1 is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, which leads to the production of insufficient SMN protein essential for motor neuron survival.

**Affected Populations:**
SMA Type 1 is the most common form of spinal muscular atrophy and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. It affects approximately 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 10,000 live births globally.

**Disorders with Similar Symptoms:**
- Congenital myopathies
- Congenital muscular dystrophy
- Myasthenia gravis
- Glycogen storage diseases

**Diagnosis:**
Diagnosis typically involves genetic testing to identify mutations in the SMN1 gene. Additional tests may include:
- Electromyography (EMG)
- Muscle biopsy
- Neurological examination

**Standard Therapies:**
- **Medication:**
  - Nusinersen (Spinraza): Approved to increase SMN protein production
  - Onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (Zolgensma): Gene therapy to replace the faulty SMN1 gene
- **Supportive Care:**
  - Respiratory support
  - Nutritional support, including feeding tubes if necessary
  - Physical therapy to maintain muscle function and reduce contractures

**Clinical Trials and Studies:**
Numerous clinical trials focus on developing new therapies and improving existing treatments. Information on up-to-date clinical trials can be accessed through resources such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

**Complete Report:**
Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 (SMA Type 1), also known as Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, is a severe genetic disorder that primarily affects infants. Due to mutations in the SMN1 gene, individuals with SMA Type 1 exhibit significant muscle weakness, poor tone, and delayed motor development. This disorder, affecting approximately 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 10,000 live births, can be diagnosed via genetic testing, EMG, and neurological exams. Treatments include medications like Spinraza and Zolgensma, along with supportive therapies. Organizations such as Cure SMA provide resources for affected families, and ongoing clinical trials aim to enhance therapeutic options.
