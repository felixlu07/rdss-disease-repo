# SMA Typ 2

### Disease Overview:
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 2 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy.

### Disease Category:
Neuromuscular Disorder

### Synonyms:
- Intermediate Spinal Muscular Atrophy
- SMA II
- Juvenile Spinal Muscular Atrophy

### Signs & Symptoms:
- Symptom onset typically between 6 and 18 months of age
- Muscle weakness, especially in the proximal muscles (those closer to the center of the body)
- Delayed motor milestones
- Fasciculations (muscle twitches) in the tongue
- Difficulty in sitting independently but usually not in walking
- Mild to moderate respiratory problems

### Causes:
SMA Type 2 is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, which is responsible for the production of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein essential for motor neuron survival.

### Affected Populations:
- SMA Type 2 affects approximately 1 in 10,000 live births
- Both males and females are equally affected

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms:
- Muscular Dystrophy
- Congenital Myopathies
- Guillain-Barre Syndrome
- Other forms of Spinal Muscular Atrophy

### Diagnosis:
- Genetic testing to identify mutations in the SMN1 gene
- Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) tests to assess muscle and nerve function
- Muscle biopsy in atypical cases

### Standard Therapies:
- Nusinersen (Spinraza): An FDA-approved antisense oligonucleotide that targets SMN2 gene splicing to increase the production of SMN protein.
- Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma): A gene replacement therapy for SMA that delivers a copy of the SMN1 gene.
- Supportive therapies such as physical therapy, respiratory care, and nutritional support.

### Clinical Trials and Studies:
Clinical trials and studies are ongoing to explore new treatments, therapies, and interventions for SMA Type 2. Patients and families can search for relevant trials on clinicaltrials.gov.

### Programs & Resources:
- Cure SMA: A patient advocacy and support organization focused on SMA
- Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA): Provides support and resources for individuals with SMA and other neuromuscular diseases

### Complete Report:
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 2 is a neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy due to the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord. The disorder typically presents between 6 and 18 months of age and affects both males and females equally. Diagnosis is confirmed through genetic testing, and treatment options include Nusinersen, Onasemnogene abeparvovec, and supportive therapies. Ongoing clinical trials aim to discover new interventions and treatments. Support and resources are available from organizations such as Cure SMA and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
