# Scn8a

**Disease Overview:**
SCN8A-related epilepsy is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide range of epilepsy symptoms, significant developmental delays, and other neurological abnormalities.

**Disease Category:**
Genetic / Neurological

**Synonyms:**
- SCN8A Epileptic Encephalopathy
- SCN8A-related epilepsy
- SCN8A mutation
- EIEE13 (Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 13)

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Seizures (may vary in type and severity)
- Developmental delays
- Intellectual disability
- Movement disorders
- Hypotonia (low muscle tone)
- Behavioral issues

**Causes:**
Mutations in the SCN8A gene, which provides instructions for making a sodium channel protein critical for normal electrical signaling in the brain, lead to dysfunction in neuronal activity.

**Affected Populations:**
SCN8A-related epilepsy can affect individuals of any race, ethnicity, or gender. It often appears in infancy or early childhood.

**Disorders with Similar Symptoms:**
- Dravet syndrome
- SCN1A-related disorders
- SCN2A-related epilepsy
- Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
- West syndrome

**Diagnosis:**
- Genetic testing to identify mutations in the SCN8A gene
- Electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect abnormal brain activity
- Clinical evaluation including medical and family history

**Standard Therapies:**
- Anti-seizure medications, although response varies and treatment resistance can occur
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Speech therapy
- Special education

**Clinical Trials and Studies:**
Research is ongoing to better understand SCN8A mutations and develop targeted therapies. Clinical trials may be available; check clinical trial registries for more details.

**Complete Report:**
SCN8A-related epilepsy encompasses rare genetic disorders resulting from mutations in the SCN8A gene, leading to various neurological symptoms, including seizures, developmental delays, and intellectual disability. It affects children of any background and is diagnosed through genetic testing and clinical evaluations. Treatment primarily focuses on managing seizures and supporting developmental needs through multidisciplinary therapies. Continued research and clinical trials aim to improve understanding and develop specific treatments for this condition. For further information and access to support resources, patients and caregivers can consult organizations like the SCN8A Alliance and the Epilepsy Foundation.
