# Severe Chronic Neutropenia

**Severe Chronic Neutropenia**

**Disease Overview:**
Severe Chronic Neutropenia (SCN) is a rare blood disorder characterized by abnormally low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell essential for fighting off infections.

**Disease Category:**
Hematologic (Blood) Disorders

**Synonyms:**
- Severe Congenital Neutropenia
- Kostmann Syndrome (when occurring congenitally)
- Idiopathic Neutropenia

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Frequent infections (e.g., pneumonia, skin infections, ear infections)
- Fever
- Mouth sores
- Periodontal disease

**Causes:**
SCN can be congenital, occurring due to genetic mutations such as those in the ELANE, HAX1, G6PC3, or other genes. It can also be idiopathic, where the cause is unknown.

**Affected Populations:**
SCN can affect both children and adults, with congenital forms typically presenting in infancy or early childhood. The exact prevalence is unknown but is considered rare.

**Disorders with Similar Symptoms:**
- Cyclic Neutropenia
- Myelodysplastic Syndromes
- Leukemia
- Aplastic Anemia

**Diagnosis:**
Diagnosis typically involves a complete blood count (CBC) revealing low neutrophil levels, bone marrow biopsy, and genetic testing to identify specific mutations.

**Standard Therapies:**
- Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) injections to stimulate neutrophil production
- Antibiotics and antifungal medications for treating infections
- Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation in severe cases

**Clinical Trials and Studies:**
A comprehensive list of clinical trials can be accessed via clinicaltrials.gov. Some trials aim to explore novel therapies and better understand the genetic basis of the disease.
