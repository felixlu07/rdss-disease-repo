# Sturge Weber Syndrome

**Disease Overview:**
Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) is a rare, congenital disorder characterized by a facial birthmark (port-wine stain) and neurological abnormalities due to abnormal blood vessels in the brain.

**Disease Category:**
Neurological and Vascular Disease

**Synonyms:**
- Encephalotrigeminal Angiomatosis
- Sturge-Weber Disease

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Port-wine stain (nevus flammeus) on the face, usually affecting one side
- Seizures
- Developmental delays
- Glaucoma
- Headaches
- Hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body)
- Intellectual disability

**Causes:**
SWS is caused by somatic mutations in the GNAQ gene. This mutation is not inherited but occurs randomly during early development.

**Affected Populations:**
SWS affects males and females equally and can occur in any ethnic group. The incidence is approximately 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 50,000 newborns.

**Disorders with Similar Symptoms:**
- Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome
- Parkes Weber Syndrome
- Other forms of facial vascular malformations
- Other neurocutaneous syndromes

**Diagnosis:**
Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on the presence of facial port-wine stains and neurological symptoms. Imaging studies such as MRI and CT scans can reveal brain abnormalities. Ophthalmological examinations are important for detecting glaucoma.

**Standard Therapies:**
- **Medical Treatment:** Anticonvulsant medication for seizures
- **Laser Treatment:** Pulsed dye laser for port-wine birthmarks
- **Surgery:** Procedures for glaucoma and rare surgical interventions for neurological symptoms
- **Supportive Care:** Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and educational support

**Clinical Trials and Studies:**
Clinical trials for Sturge-Weber Syndrome can be located at ClinicalTrials.gov. Current studies focus on novel therapeutic approaches and the genetic understanding of SWS.
