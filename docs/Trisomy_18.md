# Trisomy 18

**Disease Overview:**
Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 18. It is associated with a high degree of mortality and significant cognitive and developmental impairments.

**Disease Category:**
Genetic Disorder

**Synonyms:**
- Edwards syndrome
- Trisomy E

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Severe intellectual disability
- Growth deficiency
- Craniofacial abnormalities
- Congenital heart defects
- Clenched hands with overlapping fingers
- Muscle tone abnormalities
- Underdeveloped lungs

**Causes:**
Trisomy 18 is caused by a random error in cell division known as nondisjunction, resulting in an extra copy of chromosome 18.

**Affected Populations:**
Trisomy 18 occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 7,000 live births. It is more common in females than in males.

**Disorders with Similar Symptoms:**
- Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)
- Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)
- Turner syndrome
- Other chromosomal abnormalities

**Diagnosis:**
Diagnosis can be made prenatally through various methods, including:
- Ultrasound
- Amniocentesis
- Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)
Postnatal diagnosis involves clinical examination and genetic testing such as karyotyping.

**Standard Therapies:**
There is no cure for Trisomy 18. Standard therapies focus on supportive care and may include:
- Medical management of symptoms and complications
- Surgical interventions for congenital abnormalities
- Palliative care for severe cases

**Programs & Resources:**
- Support groups for families affected by Trisomy 18
- Genetic counseling services
- Pediatric care specialized in genetic disorders

**Complete Report:**
Trisomy 18, or Edwards syndrome, is a serious genetic disorder caused by an extra chromosome 18. Affected individuals typically exhibit profound intellectual disability, various significant congenital anomalies, and a high rate of mortality. The diagnosis is often made prenatally through genetic testing methods like ultrasound, amniocentesis, or chorionic villus sampling, and confirmed postnatally via karyotyping. Management predominantly involves supportive and palliative care, with interventions tailored to address specific health issues. While there are no cures, multidisciplinary care aims to improve quality of life. Support groups and genetic counseling are crucial resources for affected families.
