# Tuberous Sclerosis

### Tuberous Sclerosis

#### Disease Overview:
Tuberous Sclerosis is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors in multiple organs, including the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, eyes, and lungs. The severity of the condition can vary greatly among individuals.

#### Disease Category:
Genetic/Neurocutaneous Disorder

#### Synonyms:
- Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)
- Bourneville Disease

#### Signs & Symptoms:
- Seizures
- Developmental delay and intellectual disability
- Skin abnormalities (hypomelanotic macules, facial angiofibromas)
- Behavioral problems (e.g., autism spectrum disorder)
- Kidney issues (angiomyolipomas, renal cysts)
- Heart tumors (cardiac rhabdomyomas)
- Lung disease (lymphangioleiomyomatosis)
- Eye abnormalities (retinal hamartomas)

#### Causes:
Caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which code for proteins hamartin and tuberin respectively, both involved in cell growth and regulation.

#### Affected Populations:
Tuberous Sclerosis affects approximately 1 in 6,000 live births. It is found worldwide in all ethnic groups and genders.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms:
- Neurofibromatosis
- Sturge-Weber syndrome
- Von Hippel-Lindau disease

#### Diagnosis:
- Clinical evaluation and detailed patient history
- Genetic testing for TSC1 and TSC2 mutations
- Imaging studies (MRI, CT scans) for brain, kidneys, and lungs
- Echocardiograms and renal ultrasounds

#### Standard Therapies:
- Antiepileptic drugs for seizure control
- mTOR inhibitors (e.g., everolimus) for tumor management
- Behavioral therapy and educational support
- Surgical interventions, depending on tumor location and complications
- Symptomatic treatment for skin lesions and other manifestations

#### Clinical Trials and Studies:
More information about ongoing clinical trials and studies can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov and other medical research databases.

#### References:

#### Programs & Resources:
- Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance
- National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)
- The LAM Foundation (specific to lung involvement)

#### Complete Report:
A complete report covering Tuberous Sclerosis can provide detailed information on its clinical features, management strategies, and ongoing research efforts. More extensive data can be gathered from specialized medical literature and support organizations dedicated to the disorder.

For further information, professionals and patients are encouraged to seek out resources such as the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance, medical institutions specializing in genetic disorders, and peer-reviewed journals on neurocutaneous syndromes.
