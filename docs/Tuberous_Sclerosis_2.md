# Tuberous Sclerosis 2

**Tuberous Sclerosis 2**

**Disease Overview:**
Tuberous Sclerosis 2 (TSC2) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of benign tumors in multiple organs including the brain, kidneys, heart, lungs, and skin. The condition varies widely in severity and symptoms among affected individuals.

**Disease Category:**
Genetic Disorder

**Synonyms:**
- TSC2

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Epileptic seizures
- Cognitive impairment or developmental delays 
- Skin abnormalities such as hypomelanotic macules (white patches), facial angiofibromas, and shagreen patches
- Renal angiomyolipomas (benign kidney tumors)
- Lung involvement (lymphangioleiomyomatosis, particularly in women)
- Cardiac rhabdomyomas (benign heart tumors)
- Retinal hamartomas (benign eye tumors)

**Causes:**
TSC2 is caused by mutations in the TSC2 gene located on chromosome 16. The TSC2 gene codes for the protein tuberin, which is involved in cell growth and differentiation. Mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern or occur de novo (spontaneously).

**Affected Populations:**
TSC2 affects both males and females of all ethnic backgrounds. The estimated prevalence is 1 in 6,000 live births.

**Disorders with Similar Symptoms:**
- Neurofibromatosis
- Sturge-Weber syndrome
- Von Hippel-Lindau disease
- Proteus syndrome

**Diagnosis:**
Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and can be confirmed through genetic testing to identify mutations in the TSC2 gene. Imaging studies such as MRI and CT scans, as well as ECG and echocardiograms, are also commonly used to identify characteristic tumors and other abnormalities.

**Standard Therapies:**
- Antiepileptic drugs for seizures
- Surgical interventions for symptomatic tumors
- mTOR inhibitors like everolimus to shrink tumors
- Dermatologic treatments for skin lesions
- Regular monitoring of organ function and imaging studies to track disease progression

**Clinical Trials and Studies:**

**Complete Report:**
The complete report involves understanding the genetic basis, comprehensive management strategies, and potential participation in ongoing clinical trials to explore new therapies. Regular consultations with healthcare providers specialized in TSC2 and genetic diseases are crucial for optimal management and improving quality of life.
