# Tuberous Sclerosis Complex

### Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)

#### Disease Overview:
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous noncancerous (benign) tumors in many parts of the body.

#### Disease Category:
Genetic disorder, neoplastic disease.

#### Synonyms:
- Tuberous Sclerosis
- Bourneville Disease

#### Signs & Symptoms:
- Skin abnormalities including facial angiofibromas, hypomelanotic macules, and shagreen patches
- Neurological symptoms such as seizures, developmental delays, and intellectual disabilities
- Behavioral problems like autism spectrum disorders and ADHD
- Renal issues including angiomyolipomas and cysts
- Pulmonary involvement in the form of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (especially in women)
- Cardiac rhabdomyomas
- Retinal hamartomas

#### Causes:
TSC is primarily caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.

#### Affected Populations:
This condition affects all ethnic groups and genders equally, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 6,000 live births and a prevalence of about 1 in 20,000 individuals.

#### Disorders with Similar Symptoms:
- Neurofibromatosis
- Sturge-Weber Syndrome
- Von Hippel-Lindau Disease
- Proteus Syndrome

#### Diagnosis:
Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on the presence of major and minor diagnostic criteria. Genetic testing can confirm mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. Imaging studies, such as MRI, are utilized to detect brain and kidney involvement. EEG may be conducted to evaluate seizure activity.

#### Standard Therapies:
- Antiepileptic drugs for seizure control
- Everolimus (an mTOR inhibitor) to reduce tumor size
- Surgical interventions for symptomatic tumors
- Behavioral and educational support
- Regular monitoring and follow-up for the management of symptoms

#### Clinical Trials and Studies:
Several clinical trials are underway to evaluate new therapeutic approaches, particularly focusing on mTOR inhibitors and their effects on various manifestations of TSC.

#### Complete Report:
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder that affects multiple organs due to benign tumor growth. It is categorized under genetic disorders and neoplastic diseases and is also known as Bourneville Disease. Individuals with TSC exhibit a wide range of symptoms including skin abnormalities, neurological issues such as seizures and developmental delays, behavioral problems, renal complications, pulmonary involvement, and cardiac and retinal conditions. The condition is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. It affects all ethnicities and genders equally. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but supported by genetic testing and various imaging studies. Standard therapies include antiepileptic drugs, mTOR inhibitors, and surgical interventions along with supportive care. Research and clinical trials are ongoing, particularly focusing on mTOR inhibitors. Resources such as the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke offer support and information.
