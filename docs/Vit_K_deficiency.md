**Disease Overview:**
Vitamin K deficiency is a condition where the body lacks sufficient vitamin K, an essential nutrient required for blood clotting and bone metabolism.

**Complete Report:**
Vitamin K deficiency is primarily a nutritional deficiency disorder characterized by insufficient levels of vitamin K, essential for blood coagulation and bone health. Commonly referred to as hypovitaminosis K or VKDB in neonates, the condition manifests through easy bruising, excessive bleeding, and internal hemorrhages. Causes include inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption disorders, liver disease, and the impact of certain antibiotics. Individuals most at risk include newborns, especially if breastfed without vitamin K supplementation, and those with malabsorption issues or on long-term antibiotic treatments. Diagnosis typically involves blood tests to determine clotting times and vitamin K levels. Treatment is usually through supplementation and dietary improvements.
