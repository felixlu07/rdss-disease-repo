# West Syndrome

**Disease Overview:**
West Syndrome is a rare, severe form of epilepsy that typically begins in infancy. It is characterized by a specific type of seizure known as infantile spasms, and it is often associated with an abnormal brain wave pattern called hypsarrhythmia.

**Disease Category:**
Neurological Disorder; Epileptic Disorder

**Synonyms:**
- Infantile Spasms
- Epileptic Spasms
- Generalized Flexion Epilepsy

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Infantile spasms (sudden, synchronous contractions of the neck, trunk, and limbs)
- Developmental regression or delay
- Abnormal brain wave patterns (hypsarrhythmia)

**Causes:**
- Structural brain abnormalities (e.g., tuberous sclerosis, cortical dysplasia)
- Genetic mutations (e.g., ARX, CDKL5, STXBP1 genes)
- Metabolic disorders
- Prenatal and perinatal factors (e.g., hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy)

**Affected Populations:**
Primarily infants, usually presenting between 3 to 12 months of age. It affects both males and females equally.

**Disorders with Similar Symptoms:**
- Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
- Dravet Syndrome
- Early Myoclonic Encephalopathy
- Ohtahara Syndrome

**Diagnosis:**
- Clinical evaluation and detailed patient history
- EEG to detect hypsarrhythmia
- Imaging studies (MRI, CT scans) to identify underlying structural brain abnormalities
- Genetic testing to identify potential mutations

**Standard Therapies:**
- Anti-seizure medications (e.g., adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], vigabatrin)
- Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone)
- Ketogenic diet in resistant cases
- Surgery in cases with identifiable focal lesions

**Clinical Trials and Studies:**
Information on ongoing clinical trials and studies can be found in databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

**Complete Report:**
West Syndrome, also known as Infantile Spasms, is a rare neurological disorder characterized by specific seizure types, developmental delays or regression, and abnormal EEG patterns. The syndrome primarily affects infants between the ages of 3 to 12 months. Etiology can be multifactorial, including structural brain abnormalities, genetic mutations, metabolic disorders, and prenatal/perinatal factors. Diagnosis typically involves clinical evaluation, EEG, imaging studies, and genetic testing. Standard treatments include medications such as ACTH and vigabatrin, corticosteroids, dietary therapy, and surgical intervention in specific cases. Ongoing research and clinical trials aim to improve understanding and treatment outcomes for affected individuals. For further information, reference materials and resources from relevant organizations should be consulted.
