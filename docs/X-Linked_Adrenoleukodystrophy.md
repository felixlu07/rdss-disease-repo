# X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy

**Disease Overview:**  
X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and adrenal glands, leading to the buildup of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in the body.

**Disease Category:**  
Genetic, Metabolic Disorders

**Synonyms:**  
- Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)  
- Siemerling-Creutzfeldt Disease  
- Schilder's Disease

**Signs & Symptoms:**  
- Progressive loss of myelin in the central nervous system
- Adrenal gland dysfunction (Addison's disease)
- Behavioral changes
- Vision and hearing impairment
- Difficulty walking and weakness
- Seizures

**Causes:**  
X-ALD is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene located on the X chromosome, which is responsible for producing a protein that helps break down VLCFAs.

**Affected Populations:**  
X-ALD primarily affects males, though female carriers can exhibit milder symptoms. The onset can range from childhood to adulthood.

**Disorders with Similar Symptoms:**  
- Multiple Sclerosis  
- Addison's Disease  
- Other Leukodystrophies  
- Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia

**Diagnosis:**  
- Blood tests measuring VLCFA levels
- Genetic testing for ABCD1 mutations
- Adrenal function tests
- Brain MRI to detect demyelination

**Standard Therapies:**  
- Lorenzo's Oil (a mixture of fats aiming to normalize VLCFA levels)
- Adrenal hormone replacement
- Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for early-stage cerebral X-ALD
- Physical therapy
- Symptomatic and supportive treatments
