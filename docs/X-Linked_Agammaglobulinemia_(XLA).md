# X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA)

**Disease Overview:**
X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to fight infections. It is characterized by the absence or low levels of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood, which are crucial for the immune system to function properly.

**Disease Category:**
Primary Immunodeficiency Disease

**Synonyms:**
- Bruton Agammaglobulinemia
- Congenital Agammaglobulinemia
- XLA

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Recurrent bacterial infections such as ear infections, sinusitis, and pneumonia
- Infections often become noticeable in infancy and early childhood
- Poor response to vaccines
- Decreased or absent tonsils and lymph nodes

**Causes:**
XLA is caused by mutations in the BTK (Bruton tyrosine kinase) gene, which is located on the X chromosome. This gene is essential for the development and maturation of B cells, which produce antibodies.

**Affected Populations:**
- Primarily affects males due to the X-linked recessive inheritance pattern
- Estimated prevalence is 1 in 200,000 live male births

**Disorders with Similar Symptoms:**
- Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)
- Hyper IgM syndrome
- Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)
- Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)

**Diagnosis:**
- Measurement of serum immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, IgM)
- Flow cytometry to assess B cell numbers
- Genetic testing to confirm mutations in the BTK gene

**Standard Therapies:**
- Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IVIG or SCIG)
- Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections
- Regular monitoring and treatment of infections
