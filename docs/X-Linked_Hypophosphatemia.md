# X-Linked Hypophosphatemia

**Disease Overview:**
X-Linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a rare genetic disorder characterized primarily by low levels of phosphate in the blood due to renal phosphate wasting.

**Disease Category:**
Genetic disorder; Metabolic bone disease

**Synonyms:**
- X-Linked Vitamin D-Resistant Rickets
- Hypophosphatemic Rickets

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Bone pain and muscle weakness
- Rickets in children, leading to bowing of the legs
- Osteomalacia in adults
- Dental abnormalities, such as spontaneous dental abscesses

**Causes:**
XLH is caused by mutations in the PHEX gene on the X chromosome, which leads to dysregulation of phosphate homeostasis.

**Affected Populations:**
XLH affects both males and females. Males with the mutation typically have more severe symptoms. The prevalence is estimated to be about 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 60,000 live births.

**Disorders with Similar Symptoms:**
- Autosomal Dominant Hypophosphatemic Rickets (ADHR)
- Autosomal Recessive Hypophosphatemic Rickets (ARHR)
- Fanconi Syndrome
- Hereditary Hypophosphatemic Rickets with Hypercalciuria (HHRH)

**Diagnosis:**
Diagnosis often involves a combination of clinical evaluation, family history, biochemical tests showing low blood phosphate levels and high levels of phosphate in urine, and genetic testing to identify mutations in the PHEX gene.

**Standard Therapies:**
- Oral phosphate supplements
- Active forms of vitamin D (e.g., calcitriol, alfacalcidol)
- Burosumab, a monoclonal antibody against Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23)

**Clinical Trials and Studies:**
Clinical trials for XLH can be found on platforms such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which lists ongoing and completed studies related to the disease.

**Complete Report:**
X-Linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a rare genetic disorder primarily impacting phosphate regulation due to PHEX gene mutations. It manifests as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, with potential dental complications. While XLH occurs in both sexes, it typically presents more severely in males. Diagnosis involves biochemical tests and genetic confirmation. Standard treatment includes phosphate supplements, vitamin D derivatives, and newer therapies like Burosumab. Comprehensive resources and support are accessible through specialized organizations and clinical trial registries.
