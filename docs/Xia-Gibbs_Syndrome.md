# Xia-Gibbs Syndrome

**Xia-Gibbs Syndrome**

**Disease Overview:**
Xia-Gibbs Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features. It was first described in 2014.

**Disease Category:**
Genetic Disorder

**Synonyms:**
- XG Syndrome
- AHDC1-related intellectual disability

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Global developmental delays
- Intellectual disability
- Speech delays
- Sleep disturbances
- Hypotonia (low muscle tone)
- Distinctive facial features, such as a broad forehead, downslanting palpebral fissures, and a small mouth
- Feeding difficulties in infancy
- Possible congenital anomalies

**Causes:**
Xia-Gibbs Syndrome is caused by mutations in the AHDC1 gene located on chromosome 1.

**Affected Populations:**
Xia-Gibbs Syndrome affects males and females equally. Given its rare nature, the exact prevalence is unknown.

**Disorders with Similar Symptoms:**
- Angelman Syndrome
- Rett Syndrome
- Smith-Magenis Syndrome
- Other neurodevelopmental disorders

**Diagnosis:**
Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical evaluation and genetic testing to identify mutations in the AHDC1 gene.

**Standard Therapies:**
- Symptomatic treatment and supportive care
- Early intervention programs for developmental delays
- Speech, occupational, and physical therapy
- Management of sleep disturbances with appropriate interventions

**Clinical Trials and Studies:**

**Complete Report:**
Xia-Gibbs Syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the AHDC1 gene and is marked by developmental delays, intellectual disability, and unique facial features. Diagnosis relies on clinical symptoms and genetic testing. While no cure exists, management focuses on symptomatic treatment, supportive care, and various therapies to enhance quality of life. Further research may provide additional insights into the syndrome's mechanisms and treatments. References include primary research articles and genetic information databases.
